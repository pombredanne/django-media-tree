TODO: Add support for default templates (for instance
"templates/media_types/image.html", "templates/extensions/flv.html")

TODO: support for more file alternatives (preview, other streaming format etc)
-- solution would probably be ManyToManyField to self with specifying a type.
There would be a third node_type PACKAGE, a special kind of folder.

TODO: Output of CMS plugins should be refactored as media_tree.contrib.widgets
for easy use with other systems.
